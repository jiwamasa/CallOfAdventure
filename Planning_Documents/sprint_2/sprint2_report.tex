\section{Actions To Stop Doing}
\begin{itemize}
	\item At this point, we would like to avoid adding any new big features. Most of the main features have been 
implemented, but a lot of them are kind of rough. Rather than add new features, we would like to now polish 
the features we have implemented. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Actions To Start Doing}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Start focusing on style and presentation. 
	\item Make decisive design decisions for the game aspects (how hard battles should be, etc).

	\item Static asset generation (art).
\end{itemize}

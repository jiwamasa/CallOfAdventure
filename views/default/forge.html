<h1>Forge an Item</h1>
<p>
  The local blacksmith is known across the world as one of the best --
  Too bad he's completely insane. When we order swords he gives us
  shields, when we ask for shields he gives us coloured marbles, and
  when we tried to ask for coloured marbles (just for fun), he gave
  us a delightful mug with a kitten on it. 
</p>
<p>
  Over the years the Adventurer's Guild has at least partially figured out
  how to reason with this unreasonable character. You'll need 3 things:
  <ol>
    <li>Rare Ore to forge with</li>
    <li>Alcohol to 'lubricate the mind' (as he puts it)</li>
    <li>Words of encouragement</li>
  </ol>
  Through some combination of these three things, maybe, <i>maybe</i>,
  you'll get what you want (but you'll probably have to experiment).
